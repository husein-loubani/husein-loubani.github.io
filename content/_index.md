          description: As part of my Master's thesis at ImViA Lab, I worked on visuo-tactile perception for in and on-hand robotic manipulation, focusing on detecting object slippage using the Franka Emika 3 Panda robot: 
          – Developed a visuo-tactile fusion pipeline using LSTM and GRU-based RNN models to estimate object pose during dynamic manipulation, even under occlusion.
          – Designed and executed pick-and-place experiments in simulation using PyBullet and transitioned models to a real-world robotic platform.
          – Integrated tactile sensing with vision data to detect object slippage during actions like rotation, sliding, and flipping.
          – Built pose estimation and control modules in Python and implemented the complete system on ROS using the Franka Emika 3 Panda arm.
          – Evaluated performance through quantitative pose error metrics and object visibility-based visualization tools.
